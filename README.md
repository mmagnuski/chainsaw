# chainsaw
Set of tools for psycho(py). Contains an experiment class that easies things up and a bunch of useful functions.

Some of the things that `chainsaw` helps with:
* reading settings from `settings.yaml` file
* showing instructions built from images or text files, where some of the pages are python functions (allows to show actual trial examples as part of the instructions) 
* showing breaks every n trials
* training that continues conditional on participant correctness
* fitting stimuli intensity with a staircase or the quest plus method
* sending triggers through LPT or C-pod device
* simple interface to gather responses from Cedrus response box (`getKeys` and `waitKeys` just like when using keyboard in psychopy)
* saving triggers to a `.log` file (helps testing triggers without LPT port, Cedrus C-POD or in general without the recording device)

The two core elements of experiment built with `chainsaw` are the experiment object (subclassed from `chainsaw.exp_utils.Experiment`) and the `settings.yaml` file.
